This projects contains a CUDA implementation for the Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) detector and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor, as described in [Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf). Currently, only the DoG detector part is implemented. The implementation is intented for Windows, and was tested on Windows 10 Educational, with an NVIDIA GeForce 2060 RTX GPU.
